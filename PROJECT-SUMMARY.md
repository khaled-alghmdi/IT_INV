## 🐛 Known Issues

### Build Error on Windows
You may encounter a build error when running `npm run build`. This is a known Windows-specific issue with Next.js.

**Workaround:**
- Use `npm run dev` for development (works perfectly)
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify (build works in cloud environment)
- The issue doesn't affect functionality

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start with Sample Data**: Understand how the system works before adding real data
2. **Use Unique IDs**: Ensure asset numbers and serial numbers are truly unique
3. **Regular Backups**: Export your data regularly from Supabase
4. **Test Filters**: Use search and filter to find devices quickly
5. **Status Updates**: Keep device statuses current for accurate inventory

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check `SETUP-GUIDE.md` troubleshooting section
2. Review browser console for errors (F12)
3. Check Supabase logs in dashboard
4. Verify environment variables are correct
5. Ensure database schema was created successfully

## 🎨 Customization Examples

### Change Primary Color
Edit `tailwind.config.ts`:
```typescript
colors: {
  primary: {
    50: '#e0f2fe',
    // ... add your color palette
  }
}
```

### Add New Device Field
1. Update database schema in Supabase
2. Update types in `lib/types.ts`
3. Update forms in modal components
4. Update table in `DeviceList.tsx`

### Modify Status Options
