## 📁 What Was Added

### **New Page**
- `app/users/page.tsx` - The users & devices admin page

### **Updated Components**
- `components/Header.tsx` - Added navigation links:
  - 📊 **Dashboard** - Main inventory view
  - 👥 **Users** - Users & devices view
  - Active page highlighting

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **User-Device Matching**
The system matches devices to users by comparing:
- Device `assigned_to` field (email)
- User email from Supabase Auth

When you assign a device to someone:
1. Enter their email in the `assigned_to` field
2. They'll appear in the Users page
3. Their devices will be listed under their name

---

## 🔐 Important: Admin API Access

**⚠️ CRITICAL SETUP REQUIRED:**

The Users page uses `supabase.auth.admin.listUsers()` which requires **Service Role** privileges.

### **Option 1: Add Service Role Key (For Admin Features)**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Settings → API
3. Copy **service_role** key (⚠️ Keep this secret!)
4. Add to `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://kjbfytlkefgjylpbimnk.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...(service role key)
```

5. Update `lib/supabase.ts` to create admin client

### **Option 2: Simplified Version (No Admin API)**

If you don't want to use admin API, the page can work with a simpler approach:
- Just show devices grouped by `assigned_to` field
- No need to fetch actual user accounts

---

## 💡 How to Use

### **Access the Users Page**

1. **From Dashboard:**
   - Click **"Users"** in the navigation bar
   - Or go to: http://localhost:3000/users

2. **View User Details:**
   - Click on any user to expand/collapse their devices
   - See all devices assigned to them

3. **Search Users:**
   - Use the search bar at the top

### **Assign Devices to Users**

1. Go to **Dashboard**
2. Click **"Add Device"** or **Edit** existing device
3. Set status to **"Assigned"**

5. The device will now appear under that user in Users page

## 📊 Example Workflow

   - Email: `john@company.com`

2. **Assign Device to User**
   - Dashboard → Add Device
   - Asset: `AST-100`
   - Type: `Laptop`
   - Status: `Assigned`
   - Assigned To: `john@company.com`

3. **View in Users Page**
   - Navigate to `/users`
   - See `john@company.com` listed
   - Shows: 1 device
   - Click to expand and see `AST-100`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **"Error fetching users"**

**Cause:** Missing admin API access

**Solutions:**
1. Add service role key to `.env.local`
2. Or modify code to work without admin API (I can help!)

### **No users showing**

**Check:**
- Users have signed up via `/signup`
- Database connection is working
- Check browser console for errors

### **Devices not matching users**

**Issue:** Email mismatch

**Fix:**
- Make sure `assigned_to` field uses **exact email** from user account
- Email is case-insensitive in matching

### **Page is slow**

**Normal:** The page fetches all users and devices
**If very slow:** You may have many users - pagination can be added

---

## ✨ Future Enhancements

You can add:

1. **Pagination** - For many users
2. **Export to Excel** - User report
3. **Device History** - Track reassignments
4. **User Profiles** - Detailed user info
5. **Filters** - By device type, date range
6. **Bulk Operations** - Assign multiple devices
7. **Email Notifications** - When devices assigned
